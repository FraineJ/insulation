                                            <p>Your home benefits by saving in costs and energy usage. Upgrading your insulation helps to reduce your energy bills, which increases energy efficiency while also improving comfort and indoor air quality. The tax credits and rebates encourage these upgrades by reducing the cost it will take to improve your home’s energy efficiency.</p>

                                            <p>According to the EPA’s study on sources of greenhouse gas emissions, the commercial and residential sector was responsible for 13% in 2020. Other sources project an updated statistic of 25%, taking into account building construction, product use, and waste in households and businesses. The Act is projected to reduce pollution by 40% by 2023, using rebates and tax credits to incentivize property owners to make energy-efficiency improvements.</p>

                                            <p>Each state has rebate programs that help reduce the cost of certain home improvements. <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/rebate-finder" target="_blank">ENERGY STAR Rebate</a> Finder gives you the ability to find your state’s programs by zip code. You can find insulation rebates in your area by filtering the search results to “Sealing and Insulation Products”.</p>

                                        <div class="acc_content" style="display: none;">
                                            <p>Although the New Energy Efficient Home Tax Credit expired in December 2021, the IRA extended this program to December 2022, which means you can still earn credits on the qualified improvements. Although the newer rebates and credits within the IRA will go into effect as early as January 2023, you can still earn tax credits on home improvements you’ve made in 2022.</p>
                                            <p>Available tax credits will also vary per state, which means incentives may already be in place in your area.
