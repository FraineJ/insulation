If you're looking for a strong insulator that also acts as an effective air sealant, spray foam insulation is a great choice. This material is the result of a mixture of chemicals; for quality application, these are mixed on-site by a professional and sent through a hose into the stud cavity. When spray foam is applied to a surface, the chemicals react and harden to create a long-term barrier.

What is Thermal Bridging?


According to the NCMA, thermal bridging happens when “a relatively small area of a wall, floor or roof loses much more heat than the surrounding area.” A conductive material increases the rate of heat loss when there’s an imbalance of temperature between two areas, such as a heated home and the colder outside air. The most common example of a structure that allows thermal bridging would be your home’s wall studs. The cond ... </p></div>

Batt insulation or blanket insulation generally consists of fiberglass or mineral wool insulation. It is pre-cut and sized to fit most standard building sizes and are best suited for residential houses. It commonly is used in between wall studs, attic rafters, and ceiling joists. This type of insulation can be used throughout the house, insulating floors, walls, ceiling, and attics as well as basements and crawl spaces.&nbsp;

Have you ever experienced irregular temperatures throughout your home? Many people report feeling like one room in their house is hotter or colder than the rest of the environment. It can be time-consuming trying to solve the problem without a professional evaluation - is it your insulation, HVAC unit, or maybe air leakage from poorly sealed windows and doorways? Here's not only how you can get to the bottom of temperature regulation, but how to maintain a comfortable environment.

Changing the interior design, creating more natural lighting, and ensuring your HVAC system isn’t over or underperforming.

As one of the most recognizable insulations on the market, fiberglass is a type of insulation that is either blown-in or installed in batts.
